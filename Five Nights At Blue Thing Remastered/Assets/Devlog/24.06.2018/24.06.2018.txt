To Do
==========
Comment all scripts
add save slots to the game intead of "New Game" & "Continute" ala Doom 2016 (see screenshot)
Have three save slots
If playerprefs.getint("Currentnight" + that specific save slot, will need to be manually defined) > 0 then change "NEW SLOT" to "GAME SLOT 01,02 or O3 respecively"

When Night 1-5 loads set the following attributes to playerprefs("definingstring" + save slot number)
----
Power
batterys[0 - 4]
textmanager.powerstatus
----

Change "New Game" to Play Game
When they click the button transist to the select save state screen
Have the "START GAME" & "EXTRAS" texts fade out and the select save stage text fade in

Have the following data availiable to the player when they bring up that save state:
Last Played : Date & Time
The night they're currently on
The power in the main battery
The power in all of the auxilery batteries
The option to delete their data
Large Text labelled "Start" that when pressed goes to the loading frame

Furthermore we need to set an int based on the currently selected state and pass this int to both the loading screen and the "Night 1-5" scene.
This is int will assure that the correct night is displayed and the correct data is loaded for that night.
